            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>In 2013, Matt and Jen Stone of Fall Creek, Wisconsin adopted a horse named Max from an equine rescue in Minnesota that was closing. Max was originally rescued from an auction where he was brought by his owner due to sustaining a significant injury and requiring months of rehabilitation.</p>
            <p>The mission of Phoenix Rising is to save unwanted horses from abuse, neglect, starvation, and slaughter and provide for their care and training. Over the last nine years, Phoenix Rising has taken in unwanted owner surrenders, attended auctions and bid on horses at risk of being shipped for slaughter, and worked side by side with other rescues to coordinate surrender events. Due to many of these horses having health issues or being aged and not likely candidates for adoption, the focus of Phoenix has evolved into a sanctuary and “last stop” for horses to live out their life in comfortable retirement.</p>
